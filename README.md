coffee-pong
===========

A small clone of the Pong game in CraftyJS, written in CoffeeScript

## Building

Since this is written in CoffeeScript, JavaScript and HTML, there's no need to build.

## ...How to run it then?

Our lovely CoffeeScript made it super simple. Follow these steps:

**1 Get the source**

1 a) If you don't use Git, click the 'download' button and save it

1 b) If you use Git, clone it with `git clone https://github.com/Pisces000221/coffee-pong.git`.

**2 Open the browser**

2 a) If you are extremely bored, open your browser and type the full path of `index.html` in the address bar.

2 b) If you are very bored, open your browser and drag `index.html` into the window.

2 c) Otherwise, double-click the file `index.html` in Explorer, nautilus or Finder, or something else.

**3 Ready to run**

Find a friend to play with you first.

Put your fingers above the up and down arrow keys.

Tell your friend to put his/her fingers above the 'W' and 'S' keys.

**4 Have fun**

Play the game!
